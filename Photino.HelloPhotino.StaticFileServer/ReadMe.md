## Getting Started with HelloPhotino.StaticFileServer
This sample demonstrates how to create a basic starter app in a Photino.NET application. It utilizes Photino.NET.Server which serves (often bundled) UI files from a local ASP.NET server. This gets around issues with serving JavaScript modules, bundles, and other resources from static files and allows the UI to make standard service calls to the .NET back end if desired.

### Photino.NET.Server
The UI is served from ASP.NET. Photino.NET.Server serves files from either embedded resources (built into the .NET assembly) or from the file system. In this sample, we placed the wwwroot folder in the root folder of the project, and ensured that all files in this folder are set to copy to the output folder. Alternately, any files placed in the Resources folder will be embedded into the .NET assembly and don't need to be distributed separately, so you can move the wwwroot folder there and choose to not copy the files to the output folder. In either scenario, when run, the server will create a wwwroot folder structure in the output folder. Any files placed in on disk override any embedded resources found. You can choose one or the other, or both methods.
